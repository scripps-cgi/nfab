# Skill: Persona

## Purpose

Ensure stories are grounded in user needs.

## Mandatory Rules

- Every story must reference at least one persona
- Persona includes: role, goal, pain points, success metrics
- Do not invent personas; confirm if none provided

## Preferred Patterns

- 1–2 sentence job-to-be-done
- Primary persona first, secondary persona optional

## Examples

### ✅ Good

Persona: "Logged-in buyer — wants to quickly reorder past purchases to save time."

### ❌ Bad

"No user specified."

## Validation

- [ ] Persona present
- [ ] Needs/goals described
