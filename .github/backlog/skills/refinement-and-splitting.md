# Skill: Refinement & Splitting

## Purpose

Ensure stories are appropriately sized and actionable.

## Mandatory Rules

- If estimated > 8 story points, split into smaller stories
- Prefer vertical slices (end-to-end) over horizontal layers
- Create follow-up stories for non-essential polish

## Splitting patterns

- Data-first: API + DB schema
- UI-first: wireframe + basic flow, then polish
- Test-first: happy-path story, then error handling

## Validation

- [ ] Story is < 8 points or split
- [ ] Each child story has its own AC
- [ ] Stories are vertical slices where possible
