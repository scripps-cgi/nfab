# Skill: Prioritization

## Purpose

Give an explicit reason for story priority.

## Mandatory Rules

- Always provide a prioritization rationale: user value, risk, or dependency
- Indicate if story blocks other work

## Preferred Patterns

- Priority buckets: P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (nice-to-have)
- Use metrics when possible (conversion lift, time saved)

## Examples

Priority: P1 — Enables checkout flow used by 60% of users, blocks A/B test.
Priority: P2 — Low user impact, no dependencies.

## Validation

- [ ] Prioritization rationale provided
- [ ] Priority level indicated
- [ ] Dependencies noted if applicable
